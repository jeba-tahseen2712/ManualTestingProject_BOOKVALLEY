## ManualTestingProject_BOOKVALLEY

This manual testing project involved testing key features of a web application, such as Sign Up, Sign In, Home, Cart, and free book access. The testing was carried out using Microsoft Excel for creating test cases and tracking results. A mind map was created using XMind for better visualization. The goal was to ensure proper functionality and identify defects affecting user experience. The testing successfully verified the applicationâ€™s main functions, while a few minor issues were identified for further improvement. Additionally, a test matrix and report were created in Jira for tracking.
